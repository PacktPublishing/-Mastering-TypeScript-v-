## About the Video Course
Writing large applications in JavaScript is a challenge. TypeScript brings JavaScript down to earth by providing optional static typing and future JavaScript features today. TypeScript gives the developer instant feedback on the code they are writing in order to catch mistakes earlier in the development process. Since it is transpiled to JavaScript, developers can take advantage of future JavaScript language features today.
This course will take you on a journey through interacting with the type system to working efficiently with more advanced features of the language. It will strengthen your knowledge of TypeScript and help you see the benefits it brings. We use an example-based approach that walks you through a restaurant ordering sample application. In addition, we go one step further by showing you how to automate custom checks on a code base and how to close statically typed gaps.
